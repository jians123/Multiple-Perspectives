        The Forbidden City is also known as the Forbidden City. In ancient China, the planning concept of "harmony
        between man and nature" was emphasized, and the stars in the sky were used to correspond to the capital
        planning, so as to highlight the legitimacy of the regime and the supremacy of imperial power. The emperor of
        heaven lived in Ziwei Palace, while the emperor of the world claimed that he was the "Son of Heaven" who was
        ordered by heaven. His residence should be a symbol of Ziwei Palace to correspond to the emperor of heaven. The
        Book of the Later Han Dynasty stated that "Ziwei Palace is the residence of God. The king built a palace and
        acted like an elephant.". Ziwei, Ziyuan, Zigong, etc. became the nickname of the imperial palace. As the feudal
        imperial palace was a forbidden area in ancient times, which was inaccessible to ordinary people, it was called
        the "Forbidden City". In the early Ming Dynasty, together with the Forbidden City, they were collectively called
        the "Imperial City". About the middle and late Ming Dynasty, they were distinguished from the Forbidden City,
        that is, the palace city was called the "Forbidden City", and the Forbidden City was called the "Imperial City".
