    <h1>The Imperial Palace</h1>
    <p class="text">
        The palace in the front of the Forbidden City was required to be grand and magnificent in architectural style at
        that time, and the courtyard was clear and open, symbolizing the supremacy of the feudal regime. The Hall of
        Supreme Harmony was located in the center of the diagonal of the Forbidden City, with ten auspicious animals on
        each corner. The designers of the Forbidden City believe that this is to show the emperor's majesty and frighten
        the world. The inner court at the rear requires a deep and compact structure, so the six palaces at the east and
        west are all in one, each with its own gate and walls, which are arranged in relative order. Behind the Inner
        Court is the Palace Garden
