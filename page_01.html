        The construction of the Forbidden City of Beijing began in the fourth year of Yongle (1406) of the Emperor
        Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty. It was built based on the Nanjing Forbidden City. It was completed in the 18th year
        of Yongle (1420) and became the imperial palace of 24 emperors in the Ming and Qing dynasties. The National Day
        of the 14th year of the Republic of China (October 10, 1925) officially opened the Palace Museum. The Forbidden
        City of Beijing is 961 meters long from north to south, 753 meters wide from east to west, surrounded by a 10
        meter high wall and a 52 meter wide moat outside. The Forbidden City has four gates, the Meridian Gate in the
        south, the Shenwu Gate in the north, the Donghua Gate in the east and the Xihua Gate in the west. Each of the
        four corners of the city wall has a charming turret. There is a folk saying that there are nine beams, eighteen
        columns and seventy-two ridges, which describes the complexity of its structure.
