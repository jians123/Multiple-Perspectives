        The buildings in the Forbidden City in Beijing are divided into two parts: the external court and the internal
        court. The center of the Outer Court is the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the Hall of Central Harmony, and the Hall
        of Preserving Harmony, which are collectively called the Three Halls. The left and right wings of the Three
        Halls are supplemented by two groups of buildings, namely, the Wenhua Hall and the Wuying Hall. The center of
        the inner court is the Palace of Heavenly Purity, the Palace of Jiaotai and the Palace of Tranquil Tranquility,
        which are collectively called the Three Emperors. They are the main palaces where the emperor and empress live.
        After that, there is the Imperial Garden. The eastern and western six palaces are arranged on both sides of the
        rear three palaces, which are the places where the empresses and concubines live and rest. On the east side of
        the Eastern Six Palaces are Buddha hall buildings such as the Heavenly Palace, and on the west side of the
        Western Six Palaces are Buddha hall buildings such as the Main Hall. In addition to the Outer Court and the
        Inner Court, there are two parts of buildings: Outer East Road and Outer West Road.
